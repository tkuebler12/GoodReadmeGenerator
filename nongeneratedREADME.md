## Application

To use this application, the user must have inquirer installed by doing an npm install inquirer in their
VSCode terminal. Once this is done, inside the terminal run the command "node readme.js" and then the
terminal should prompt the user to fill out information that the application will then use to generate
the README file for the user. Provided below is a link to a walk-through video of the application working
and a user entering their input and a README file being generated.
